# HF103-redux
### A rework of an HF SDR using USB3 derived from a design developed by Oskar Stella, ik1xpv.
This variant is meant as a straw-man starting point for discussion of project options by members of the HamSCI and TAPR groups for scientific data-collection applications.  

It is a re-capture of design elements drawn from  Oskar's HF103, BBRF103, and other sources into a schematic drawn in KiCad.
